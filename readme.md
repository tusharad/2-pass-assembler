# 2 Pass Assembler for IA-32

Python program to generate Hex translation of assembly code.

## Description

We have learned the internal workings of the 32-bit version of the x86 instruction set architecture (i386). hence, as a semester long task. I have implement a simple version of nasm assembler. Which will create symbol table and give listing of hexadecimal conversion of assembly instructions. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3
* PrettyTable module (Python)

### Executing program

* Make sure you have python,pip installed
* Install the prettyTable module via pip
